## Notifications

There are two types of [push notifications](https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging) supported.

Browsers that support [`Navigator.permissions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/permissions) and are supported by [Firebase Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/environments-js-sdk).

### My Schedule notifications

A few minutes before a sessions starts, attendees can get reminder notifications. These are sent automatically by [`schedule-notifications.ts`](functions/src/schedule-notifications.ts).

To get a notification an attendee has to:

1. Be authenticated
1. Have enabled "My Schedule notifications"
1. Have bookmarked the session that is about to start

General notifications are sent to everyone (authenticated and anonymous) who has enabled "General notifications". These are sent manually by conference organizers.
